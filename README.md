This code is exercise 2 part A in course "Biological Computation" by Hillel Kugler.

The code have been written using "PyCharm 2021.3.1 (Community Edition)".
You can download it as a folder to your local workspace and run the files.

The program named "main.py" computes, for a given "n" which is number of vertices, all unique models of connected directed sub-graphs, which called "motifs".
There are 4 text files with outputs for n=1 to 4, called "motifs_n".

Our tests show that for n=4 the program runs for 10-30 seconds.
For n=5, the program runs over 24 hours.
